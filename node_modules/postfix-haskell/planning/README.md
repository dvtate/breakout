## `brainstorm_syntax_archive/`
I make a lot of files when planning out new features and stuff.
I've included a few here. Don't expect any of them to build, they're
moreso for me to think through the syntax to see what makes most sense
and possibly share design considerations and stuff for example
on Twitter.

## `implementation/`
Sometimes I have \[what feel like] good ideas for things
that are way passed what I'm currently working on, or even that
I'm just concerned that I'll forget about it quickly. tl;dr
it's basically just fleeting thoughts in here.

## `spec/`
CBA to make a formalized language spec since nothing is set in stone,
but do occasionally enjoy making guides/intros

## `stdlib/`
This is kinda like a working (as in work in progress) standard library. Just so that I don't have to include a bunch basics in demos

## Other stuff
- `.ts` files: these are probably demos
- `.js` files: these are probably experiments/unrelated demos
- `.phs` files: test files for different features... ideally all of these would compile && unit tested... eventually
- `.wat` files: compiler/optimizer output, useful for measuring performance and optimizations over time
